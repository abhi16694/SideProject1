# Geektrust Problem : FindingFalcone

## King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these planets. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
### Our Task

1. select 4 planets to search (out of the total 6). 
2. select which space vehicles to send to these planets.
3. see how much time it will take for the vehicles to reach their targets. 
4. show Ô¨Ånal result of success or failure.
